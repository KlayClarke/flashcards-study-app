# flashcards-study-app
A Python application created using Tkinter that allows the user to learn the 100 most frequently used French words. 

When the user feels like taking a break, they can exit out of the application, with the remaining words being saved to a csv file titled 'to_learn.csv' within the data folder. 

The application reads this file the next time it is opened, allowing our users to continue where they left off.
